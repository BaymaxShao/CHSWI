This is the Pytorch Implementation of "3D (C)lothed (H)uman Model Reconstruction Based on (S)ingle-view In-the-(W)ild (I)mage Data"
**The whole code well be released when the paper is accepted.**
The contribution of this work can be summarized as below:
- Adaptive integration of convolution and multi-head attention is introduced into the feature extractor to extract the latent codes of the clothes from the input image
- Adjustment of the segmentations to filter the background information for better supervision.
